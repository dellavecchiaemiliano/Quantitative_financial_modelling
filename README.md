# Quantitative_financial_modelling
  Second year, first semester. Two interesting projects: one about the evaluation of Hurst exponent on the real financial time series "FTSE 100", the results show how far the real markets are from the efficiency, but you can see the tendency of these ones to the efficiency in the long run; an other one about a common topic in quantitative finance "the stylized facts of a financial time series". Those latter are assumptions which, being confirmed in the markets over different time periods, seem to be enough consistent to be considered correct. I take into account the same financial time series and I proved the existence of absence of autocorrelation in logarithmic returns, slow decay of autocorrelation function in absolute returns and in squared returns, volatility clustering, aggregational gaussianity, heavy tails, intermittency, gain/loss asymmetry.
